# Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Arduino Projects** repository! This repository contains various projects and examples for Arduino-based applications. Each folder within this repository represents a different project, showcasing different aspects of Arduino programming, electronics, and sensor integration.

## General Information

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of useful Arduino projects that can help you learn about:

- Sensor integration
- Display control (7-segment, LCD, etc.)
- Data processing and visualization
- Basic communication protocols (e.g., I2C, SPI, etc.)
- Actuators and motor control

The projects range from beginner to intermediate level and cover various real-world applications. Each project typically includes:

- **Source code**: Written in Arduino IDE, ready for upload to an Arduino board.
- **Hardware setup**: Pin configurations and wiring diagrams (where applicable).
- **Libraries**: Instructions for any necessary Arduino libraries or dependencies.

Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute to the repository as you explore and build your own projects!

## List of Projects

1. **Temperature Display with 7-Segment and DHT11 Sensor**
   - A simple project to read temperature from a DHT11 sensor and display it on a 4-digit 7-segment display.


## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the relevant `.ino` file.
4. Connect the necessary hardware to your Arduino board as described in the individual project folder.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board and test the project!
